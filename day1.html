							<h1>DAY 1 REVIEW</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/cover.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>We had an incredible day today with Krishnakumar sir and his wife. They were our trainers, and we learned so much from them. We did many tasks that seemed random at first, but they were all designed to improve our personalities.</p><p>

								One task we did was just clapping hands. We learned never to assume and to coordinate with the entire class to get a loud and spontaneous clap. This was so much fun, and it really helped us work as a team.</p><p>
								
								Another task we did was to run from our place to another to create uncertainty. This was so exhilarating, and we learned how to adapt to unexpected situations. Then we were asked to take numbers from 1-7 in order to create teams. The last one to reach had to do a task, which taught us that the fear of loss is a great motivator.</p><p>
								
								We also filled forms with our photos, and we had to work fast to get more points. Then there was a quiz section from all the talks sir had with us. We learned so much from this, and it was so exciting to see how much we had learned.</p><p>
								
								We also did a management exercise to improve our confidence. We unlocked our inner creativity to the utmost and learned how to be better leaders. Afterwards, we had an open section with the team to get to know each other better and filled out forms.</p><p>
								
								Sir also explained to the leaders the secret mantra of a leader, which was so fascinating. I can't wait to learn more about this in our next class. We came home feeling so motivated and ready to prepare many activities and ideas for the team.</p><p>
								
								Overall, I had an incredible day, and I'm looking forward to our next class with Krishnakumar sir and his wife. They are such great trainers, and I know we will learn so much from them. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next time.</p>
