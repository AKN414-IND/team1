							<p>A Day of Learning and Growth with Krishnakumar Sir and His Wife: Part 2

								</p><p>Today was another exciting day with Krishnakumar sir and his wife. I woke up early in the morning, did some meditation, and recollected the ideas from yesterday. After getting ready, I followed the points mentioned by sir and went to the bus stop. I got on the bus and reached college, which was 1.5 km away, around 8:45 am. However, there was a traffic block, and instead of waiting in the bus, I ran to college and reached there by 9:00 am. It was hard, but it felt great to push myself beyond my limits.
								
								</p><p>Task 1 was about presenting things before the people, like a prayer, news, etc. We were asked to show our confidence, and I was sad that I didn't get the chance to present my thoughts. However, I am determined to get the mic tomorrow and show my confidence.
								
							</p><p>We had a motivational talk with sir, and he asked us to organize an event where we introduce the team and team-related stuff. This taught me how to be an organizer, where things went wrong, what I should correct, etc.
								
							</p><p>Next was a mime where we were given a theme and had to act out a topic for the audience. Although I was a bad actor who was supposed to play a dead body, I accidentally started laughing for the sudden change in music. It was a fun experience, and I learned to take things lightly and not be afraid of making mistakes.
								
							</p><p>Then, we were given videos to watch, and sir asked questions regarding them. This made me realize that the world is cruel, and we have to work hard to succeed. Even though I knew many answers, I didn't get the chance to answer, but I will try again tomorrow.
								
							</p><p>Finally, we had a group discussion where we learned many new things about our topic. The day was closed with a question section by sir, and I am looking forward to more crazy tasks and events tomorrow. I can't wait to learn more and grow as a person.</p>
